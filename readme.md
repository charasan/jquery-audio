jQuery HTML5 Audio Plugin
=========================

This was my first attempt at writing a jQuery plugin. This plugin creates an audio player on a webpage
using HTML5 audio if it's available to the browser, and using a Flash based player in other cases.
Consideration was taken for mobile platforms as well.  Probably needs updated to account for more
recent changes in compatibility of mobile options.
